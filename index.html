    <h2>Tips for a Stress-Free Life</h2>
    <div class="tips-container">
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Establish a Routine</h3>
            <p>Commit to a daily time and place that supports calmness and focus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Create a Dedicated Space</h3>
            <p>Set up a specific area in your home for meditation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Start with Short Sessions</h3>
            <p>If you're new to meditation, begin with 5 to 10-minute sessions. As you get more comfortable with the process, gradually increase the duration. This helps build a sustainable habit without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Focus on Your Breath</h3>
            <p>Concentrate on your breathing as a way to anchor your mind. Pay attention to the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils, or the rise and fall of your chest. This focus will help you anchor the mind and keep it from wandering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Embrace Silence</h3>
            <p>While guided meditations are helpful, also try to practice in silence. This allows you to listen to and reconnect with your inner self more deeply. Silence can be very revealing and healing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Mindful Body Scanning</h3>
            <p>Start at the top of your head and move down through your body. Pay attention to each part, noticing any discomfort, tension, or relaxation without judgment. This helps connect your physical and mental awareness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Use a Meditation App</h3>
            <p>There are many great apps available that offer guided meditations for different goals (like stress reduction, gratitude, or sleep) which can be very helpful, especially for beginners looking to find a structure to follow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Practice Gratitude</h3>
            <p>Spend a few minutes during or after your meditation to think about what you’re grateful for. This can shift your mindset positively and increase feelings of well-being.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Be Patient with Yourself</h3>
            <p>Meditation is a skill that requires practice. If you find your mind wandering, gently bring it back to your breath or guide. Do not get discouraged—distraction is natural, and the act of recognizing it and returning to focus is the practice of meditation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Keep a Meditation Journal</h3>
            <p>After every session, take a few minutes to write down your experiences. This can help you track your progress, understand your challenges, and notice the benefits developing over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Experiment with Different Techniques</h3>
            <p>Explore different meditation techniques such as mindfulness, transcendental meditation, or guided visualizations to find what works best for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Set Clear Intentions</h3>
            <p>Before starting your meditation, set a clear intention for your session. Whether it’s to relax, gain clarity, or cultivate gratitude, having a purpose can make your practice more meaningful.</p>
